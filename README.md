# Crunchyroll-Server
Crunchyroll is an anime streaming and manga reading website. This is a project for the Database sessional course
based on Oracle.

# Inititation
We first run the command:
`npx express-generator crunchyroll-server`
to create the express app in the current directory. It'll be helpful to download the zip file from GitHub, extract all the files,
and run `yarn add` to install all the dependent packages.

## Demo
